Lecture 1 

Algorithm: a procedure for solving a mathamtical problem (e.g. finding the greatest common divisior) in a finite number of steps that frequently involved repetition of an operation; 

Broadly: a step-by-step procedure for solving a porblem or accomplishing some end 

Properties of algorithms: 

1- Finiteness 
2- Definiteness 
3- Input 
4- Output 
5- Effectiveness
