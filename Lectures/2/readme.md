<h3>Abstract Data Types: </h3>

What's a good code? 

-Easy to understand 

-Correctness 

-Efficiency 

-Easy to change in case there're new requirments 

So in general: 

1) It works (as specified), 2) It is easy to understand and modify 3) It is reasonably efficient 

One way to help is toi use <b>abstract data types or ADTs</b>


Abstraction: the process of which we point out some qualities and we don't care about the other details. 

ADT: are an instance of a general principle in software engineering which goes by many names: 

	Abstraction: hiding low-level details with a simpler, higher-level idea

	Modularity: Dividing a system into components or modules, each of which can designed, implemeneted, tested, reasoned about, and reused sparately from the rest of the system. 

	Encapsulation: building walls around a module so that hte module is responsible for its own internal behavior, and bugs in other parts of the system can't damage its integrity. 

	Infomration hiding: Hididng information of a module's implementation from the rest of teh system, so that those details can be changed later without changing the rest of teh system. 

	separation of concerns: making a feature that its responsibility is one task. 

<h3>User-defined types</h3>

1- Built-in types - such as integers 

2- built-in procedures, input and output 

3- users can define their own procuedures


A type is characterized by the operations you can perform on it: 

	-A number is something you can add and multiply 

	-a string is something you can concatenate and take substrings of

	-a boolean is something you can negate and so on 

All that matters is the operations
